slip of paper that he throws on the ground tying to get Rachel's attention.]</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Ross:</b> (picking up the slip of paper) Hello! What's
this? Oh right its that girl's phone number. (Rachel ignores him) Yeah-yeah, there it is,
just a phone number a really hot girl gave me. (He holds it so that Rachel can see it, she
continues to ignore him) It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number,
but...(Rachel still ignores him) Whoa! (Throws it in her lap) Whoa-whoops, I almost lost
this baby! Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it. (He waves
it in front of Rachel's face. Then suddenly Phoebe has to sneeze and Rachel quickly grabs
the slip of paper and gives it to Phoebe for her to sneeze into.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's
why I'm so glad I found Amanda.</font></p>

unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. (She
puts her shoe on the table, and it's horribly decorated) Pretty, huh? (Sneezes)</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Chandler:</b> All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get
shot down. Any advice?</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Chandler:</b> Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out
a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger
mouth.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Joey:</b> Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Phoebe:</b> Before I start, I just wanna say that umm,
I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the
last verse of Pepper People. (Starts to sing) <em>Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they
feeding you?</em> (Stops singing) This chick sounds good. (Singing) <em>Smelly cat, smelly</em>--(stops
singing) Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.</font></p>

afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Kathy:</b> Oh please!</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Chandler:</b> So ah, Joey tells me you two met in
acting class.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Kathy:</b> Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey
picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Chandler:</b> That's a good thing actually, because ah,
he used to have me rehearse with him.</font></p>

really loudly.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Joey:</b> Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to
by hamsters.</font></p>

to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Monica:</b> Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having
to live on the streets when you were 14?</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the
time my hair did that &quot;Woo-hoo&quot; thing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Monica:</b> How's it going with her?</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Ross:</b> Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe
the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep,
I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little &quot;playing&quot;
ourselves.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Josh:</b> Dudes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Monica:</b> So, did you play in college? (She points to
his NYU Soccer (football for the rest of the world) sweatshirt he's wearing.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Josh:</b> Oh, I still do. Next year, I hope to make
varsity though.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High
School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your
Commodore 64.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Josh:</b> Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to
the game, so I'm gonna... head.</font></p>

him and gives him a passionate kiss.) I'll miss you.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Rachel:</b> I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to
finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet
he's never set foot in a museum.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Ross:</b> Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a
class trip or something.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Rachel:</b> Y'know what else is really great about him,
oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Ross:</b> Oh! (He bangs his fists together.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Rachel:</b> What was that?</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Ross:</b> Monica knows.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Monica:</b> It's this dumb thing that Ross made up
`cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without
actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the
first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Ross:</b> Well, I'm gonna go get ready, (Gives Monica
the fist thing.) for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head.</font></p>
</a>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in
one hour. Hey, (clears her voice and in her normal voice) you guys should come hear me,
ooh hear me. Ooh, (tries to sing) <em>My sticky shoes</em>--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy
phlegm!</font></p>

tonight.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Ross:</b> Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Amanda:</b> Okay, well, my cell phone number is right
here on the counter, please help yourself to anything in the fridge.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Ross:</b> What?</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Amanda:</b> I appreciate this soo much, I've been
trying to go out with this guy for like a month.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Ross:</b> I-I-I...</font></p>

after the kids are asleep? Oh uh, thanks for this, I hope I can do the same for you
sometime. (She leaves)</font></p>

the leashes of five dogs, in desperation he throws his paper.) Fetch! Fetch it! (He frees
himself and resumes the chase) Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! (He now trips and falls into a pile of
garbage, he tries to get up and scream her name again but he has a piece of spinach in his
mouth. He gets out of the garbage and starts crossing the street by running over the hoods

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Monica) Here, now I don't eat chicken,
so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really
just... noodle water. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Monica:</b> Thank you so much Phoebe.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Phoebe:</b> (picking up Monica's used Kleenex and

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Chandler:</b> Y'know what I think it is? It's the
fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my
father in fishnet stockings.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Kathy:</b> Okay. Understanding a little more why you're
single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we
could double date!</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, look, what do you want from me?</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Joey:</b> I want you to like her! But if that's too
damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Chandler:</b> I am pretending.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Joey:</b> Well then, do it better!</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, what do you saw I go over there and
say how much I like her? (Joey gives him a thumbs up) No-no it'll be good, I can tell her
much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the
moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in
love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own
damn bad luck that you met her first!!</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Monica:</b> Hey Rach, could you get me some cough
drops?</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Rachel:</b> I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could
bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Monica:</b> Ross, cough drops, please?</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Ross:</b> At least I know she's not going out with me
