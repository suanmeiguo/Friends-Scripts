Do you think we should get it?</p><p><b>Chandler</b>: I don’t know. What do you think?</p><p><b>Monica</b>: I think we should.</p><p><b>Chandler</b>: I do too.</p><p><b>Monica</b>: This is huge!</p><p><b>Chandler</b>: I know.</p><p><b>Monica</b>: How bad you wanna smoke, right now.</p><p><b>Chandler</b>: I don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy’s car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.</p><p><b>Monica</b>: Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?</p><p><b>Chandler</b>: We don’t. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.</p><p><b>Monica</b>: Okay. Right.

Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can’t believe he would do this to Monica!</p><p><b>Ross</b>: I know, and with the baby coming?</p><p><b>Phoebe</b>: So, should we tell her?</p><p><b>Ross</b>: I don’t know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?</p><p><b>Phoebe</b>: Why? Who’d you seen him with?</p><p><b>Ross</b>: No one, I’m just saying if... <i>(Phoebe starts pinching him in his neck)</i></p><p><b>Phoebe</b>: TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!</p><p><b>Ross</b>: <i>(yelling in pain)</i> I know nothing! Mike’s a great guy, it was hypothetical!</p><p><b>Phoebe</b>: All right. <i>(she releases him)</i>. He is a good guy. You’re right, he wouldn’t cheat.</p><p><b>Ross</b>: Believe me, if I <em>did</em> see with someone, there’s no way I... <i>(Phoebe starts pinching him again)</i></p><p><b>Phoebe</b> : WHO DID YOU SEE HIM WITH?</p> <h3>[Scene: Monica’s apartment. Monica is cleaning with a vacuum and then she cleans it with a dust buster. The guys enter the room.]</h3> <p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh, look at her, so happy!</p><p><b>Monica</b>: If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!</p><p><b>Joey</b>: Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?</p><p><b>Monica</b>: No, he’s picking up dinner, why, what’s up?</p><p><b>Phoebe</b>: Well, look, whatever happens, we’re here for you and we love you.</p><p><b>Monica</b> <i>(puzzled)</i>: All right...</p><p><b>Ross</b>: We think Chandler might be having an affair.</p><p><b>Monica</b>: What?</p><p><b>Rachel</b>: Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.</p><p><b>Phoebe</b>: They went in together. So sorry.</p><p><b>Monica</b>: Oh my God! Oh my God that’s awful! What did you think of the house?</p><p><i>(they all look confused and sorry for her)</i></p><p><b>Phoebe</b>: What?</p><p><b>Joey</b>: <i>(walking towards her to hold her and support her)</i> Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?</p><p><b>Monica</b>: Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously... <i>(to the rest)</i> Did you think the neighborhood was homey? <i>(Chandler enters)</i></p><p><b>Chandler</b>: Hey!</p><p><b>Joey</b>: <i>(to Chandler)</i> You son of a bitch!</p><p><b>Chandler</b>: Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?</p><p><b>Monica</b>: <i>(goes to Chandler)</i> Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.</p><p><b>Rachel</b>: Who's Nancy?</p><p><b>Ross</b>: What's going on?</p><p><b>Monica</b>: <i>(turns to them)</i> Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.</p><p><b>Chandler</b>: Yeah <i>(motions them to sit and they do)</i> I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.</p><p><b>Joey</b>: I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!</p><p><b>Phoebe</b>: Why do you have a realtor?</p><p><b>Monica</b>: Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.</p><p><b>Joey</b>: <i>(clearly shocked)</i> What?</p><p><b>Rachel</b>: Are you serious?</p><p><b>Monica</b>: When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.</p><p><b>Phoebe</b>: So you're gonna move?</p><p><b>Ross</b>: Oh my God.</p><p><b>Joey</b>: Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!</p><p><b>Rachel</b>: What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!</p><p><b>Monica</b>: And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...</p><p><b>Chandler</b>: ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.</p><p><b>Ross</b>: <i>(sarcastic)</i> So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?</p><p><b>Phoebe</b>: Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?</p><p><b>Ross</b>: You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.</p><p><b>Joey</b>: No, no, it's not, don't listen to him! <i>(to Ross)</i> I'm gonna thump you! <i>(points his fist at him)</i></p><p><b>Ross</b>: <i>(to Joey)</i> It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay <i>(back to Mon and Chan)</i>, but you're going to realize, this is the <em>only</em> place, you wanna be.</p><p><i>(pause before Monica and Chandler speak, they look like they are looking for the right words)</i></p><p><b>Chandler</b>: Actually, we already found a house we love.</p><p><b>Ross</b>: What?</p><p><b>Monica</b>: And about an hour ago, we made an offer.</p><p><i>(All the friends looked shocked and confused. There is a long silence.)</i></p><p><b>Chandler</b>: Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?</p><p><b>TIME LAPSE</b></p><p><b>Ross</b>: You put an offer on a house? </p><p><b>Monica</b>: <i>(smiling)</i> It's <em>so</em> sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees... <i>(gets cut off)</i></p><p><b>Phoebe</b>: Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?</p><p><b>Chandler</b>: I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.</p><p><b>Joey</b>: Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food? <i>(Walks towards the fridge)</i> Because I can stop doing that, <i>(looks at the fridge)</i> I really, really think I can! </p><p><b>Chandler</b>: <i>(goes towards Joey)</i> You know that's not the reason Joe. <i>(Joey hugs him and after, he takes something from the fridge and puts it in his mouth. He goes back to where he was standing before)</i></p><p><b>Monica</b>: We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there. <i>(Points to Rachel and Phoebe)</i> It is beautiful, isn't it?</p><p><b>Rachel</b>: Yeah it is.</p><p><b>Joey</b>: What the hell are you doin'?</p><p><b>Rachel</b>: Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live!</p><p><b>Phoebe</b>: Yeah, but so is <em>this</em>.</p><p><b>Ross</b>: Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?</p> <h3>[We fade to some flashback scenes.]</h3> <p><i>(from <a href="http://www.eigo-i.com/friends/transcript/101">1.01 - &quot;The One Where Monica Gets a New Roommate - The Pilot&quot;</a>)</i></p><p><b>Rachel</b>: <i>(talking on the phone)</i> C'mon Daddy, listen to me!

I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.</p><p><b>All</b>: That's so sweet.</p><p><b>Ross</b>: And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.</p><p><b>Rachel</b>: And a crappy New Year.</p><p><b>Chandler</b>: Here, here!</p> <h3>[Scene: We're back to the present.

And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good. <i>(Joey pats Ross on his back)</i></p><p><b>Rachel</b>: Yeah. So don't move, okay?
