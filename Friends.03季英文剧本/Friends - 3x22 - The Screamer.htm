[Scene:  Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is on the phone, Chandler and Monica are sitting in the living room, and Ross is in the kitchen as Rachel enters from her bedroom.]<br>
<br>
<b>Rachel:</b>  Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold?  I was supposed to call my Dad back like two hours ago.<br>
<br>
<b>Phoebe:</b>  Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he’s at Flimby’s.<br>
<br>
<b>Rachel:</b>  What’s Flimby’s?<br>
<br>
<b>Phoebe:</b>  Oh, yeah, that’s the word I use when I can’t remember the real thing.<br>
<br>
<b>Rachel:</b>  Okay.  Hang up!  That’s it!  Come on!<br>
<br>
<b>Phoebe:</b>  No!  Rachel, that’s what they want me to do.  My warranty expires tomorrow, if I don’t get through, they’re not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free!  We cannot let them win!  It’s us versus them!<br>
<br>
<b>Chandler:</b>  Ye-e-es!!<br>
<br>
<b>Joey:</b>  (entering) Hey.<br>
<br>
<b>All:</b>  Hey.  <br>

<b>Joey:</b>  Uh, listen I gotta double check for tickets tonight.  Who-who got what?<br>

<b>Chandler, Phoebe, and Rachel:</b>  I had one.<br>
<br>
<b>Monica:</b>  I need two.  I’m bringing Pete.  My boyfriend.  I have a boyfriend now!<br>
<br>
<b>Joey:</b>  Two it is.  Ross, how about you?<br>
<br>
<b>Ross:</b>  Uh, yeah, I ah, I also need two.<br>
<br>
<b>Monica:</b>  Really?  Who’s number two?<br>
<br>
<b>Chandler:</b>  Who’s number two?  One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.<br>
<br>
<b>Ross:</b>  Uh, no, it’s-it’s just this person.<br>
<br>
<b>Phoebe:</b>  Like a date type (looks at Rachel) person?<br>
<br>
<b>Ross:</b>  Yeah, kinda.  It’s this woman from work.  I hope that won’t be too weird.  Will it, Rach?<br>
<br>
<b>Rachel:</b>  No.  No, not at all, not at all.  I actually was gonna bring someone myself, so?br>
<br>
<b>Joey:</b>  But you said one.<br>
<br>
<b>Rachel:</b>  I meant, me plus one!<br>
<br>
<b>Joey:</b>  Okay.  (to Phoebe and Chandler) Did ah, you guys mean you plus one?<br>

<b>Joey:</b>  Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!<br>
<br>
<b>All:</b>  Oh!<br>
<br>
<b>Joey:</b>  (to Chandler) And I ah, borrowed some of your cologne.  I hope she likes it.<br>
<br>
<b>Monica:</b>  Joey, what are you doing?!  It’s never gonna happen, she’s seeing somebody.<br>
<br>
<b>Chandler:</b>  Yeah, and I don’t have any cologne.<br>
<br>
<b>Joey:</b>  The green bottle next to the shaving cream.<br>
<br>
<b>Chandler:</b>  Oh!  Worm medicine for the duck.<br>
<br>
(In horror, Joey wipes his next and smells it.)<br>

One second!! (She is now frantically trying to get the sweater on, as Monica returns from the bathroom.) Wait!  One second!  Just?br>
<br>

<br>
<b>Ross:</b>  And!  Break!!<br>
<br>
(Awkward laughter follows.)<br>
<br>

<br>
<b>Tommy:</b>  Oh!  Oh!  The usher must be right!  What, with all that training they go through!  Get out!!  (They start to leave.) Here! (He throws him back his ticket.) (to Ross, calmly) Hey man, you want the aisle?<br>

<br>
<b>Chandler:</b>  I know.<br>
<br>

<br>
<b>Chandler:</b>   Wait a minute, wait a minute, you <b>don’t</b> like the guy Rachel’s dating?  Well, that’s odd.<br>
<br>
[cut to Joey, Rachel, and Tommy.]<br>
<br>
<b>Joey:</b>  Oh, hey, Lauren.  Uh, you guys this is, this is Kate’s understudy, Lauren.<br>
<br>

<b>Cailin:</b>  So.  How’d you guys meet?<br>
<br>
<b>Pete:</b>  Well ah, the short version is, I ah pursued her for a couple of months, then I gave her a check for 20,000 dollars, and she was mine.<br>
<br>
<b>Monica:</b>  Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.<br>
<br>
[cut to Joey as Estelle, Joey’s agent, approaches]<br>
<br>
<b>Estelle:</b>  Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!  <br>
<br>
<b>Joey:</b>  Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.<br>
<br>
<b>Estelle:</b>  How do you do.  (to Rachel and Monica) Ooh, you two girls were outstanding!  (to Joey) Did they have representation?<br>
<br>
<b>Joey:</b>  No, they-they weren’t in the play.<br>
<br>
<b>Rachel:</b>  We’re not actors.<br>
<br>
<b>Estelle:</b>  Ooh, what a shame!  Because with her face (points to Monica) and her chest (points to Rachel) I could really put something together.<br>
<br>
<b>Chandler:</b>  Could I borrow it?<br>
<br>

<br>
<b>Cailin:</b>  Ross, I’m gonna go.<br>
<br>
<b>Ross:</b>  Go?  Why?<br>
<br>
<b>Cailin:</b>  I don’t know.  Could be because I don’t feel like standing around all night waiting for some guy who <b>may</b> or may not scream.<br>
<br>
<b>Ross:</b>  But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream.<br>
<br>
<b>Cailin:</b>  Good bye Ross.<br>
<br>
<b>Ross:</b>  Uh, oh-ho bye.<br>
<br>
<b>The Director:</b>  (entering carrying a newspaper) Here we go people!  (starts reading the review) Boxing Day!  The Lucille Lortel Theatre, blah-la-la-la? Ah-ha!  Joey Tribianni, gives an uneven performance,  but Mr. Tribianni is not the worst thing in this production.<br>
<br>
<b>Joey:</b>  Yes!!!  Ha-ha-ha!<br>
<br>
<b>The Director:</b>  Kate Miller’s awkward and mannered portrayal is laughable. (Kate walks away depressed.)  Badda-badda-badda. Ah-ha!  Here it is!  The direction by Marshal Talmant is?(stops, reads it again, and throws down the paper in disgust) Thank you, boys and girls, you’ve ruined my life.  Please, stuff your talentless faces with my Mother’s crab cakes!  (starts to leave) Excuse me!!<br>
<br>
(Joey steps in a picks up the paper, the gang all look at him.)<br>

<br>
<b>Phoebe:</b>  Oh, okay, yeah.  (to Monica) I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room.<br>
<br>
(They both look at each other, nod their heads ‘All right?and follow their stuff into their new rooms.)<br>
<br>
[Scene:  The Theatre, after the party.  Joey is trying to comfort Kate.]<br>
<br>
<b>Joey:</b>  Hey!  Are you okay?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b>  Fabulous.<br>
<br>
<b>Joey:</b>  Listen, drama critics they’re nothing but, but people who couldn’t make it as actors.  You know what you should do?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b>  Become a drama critic!<br>
<br>
<b>The Director:</b>  (entering, drunk) I am hurt!  (to Joey and Kate) A plague on both your houses! (walks away)<br>

<br>
<b>Kate:</b>  Of course I do.<br>
<br>
<b>Joey:</b>  Well so, how come you blew me off?  Y'know?  How come you were with him?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b>  I don’t know!  I just, just do this!  I-I always have to pick the like the smartest guy, or-or the most talented guy? Why can’t I just pick someone like you?<br>
<br> 
<b>Joey:</b>  Thanks.<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b>  You know what I mean.  I mean like the sweetest guy.  Joey, you’re just so, you’re so, so?(She passes out and slumps against his shoulder.)<br>
<br>
<b>Joey:</b>  (Checks to see if she’s drooling on his shirt.) Okay.  Okay, okay, hey.  (Lays her down and covers her with a blanket.) There we go, let’s get your feet up there. (Looks at her) Good night, Kate.  Sweet dreams. (Picks up a garbage can) I’m gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.<br>

<br>
<b>Monica:</b>  Joey, you had the night!  <br>

<b>Chandler:</b>  Why don’t you use ours across the hall, ‘cause she…has…problems.<br>
<br>
<b>Ross:</b>  (coming out of the kitchen with a cup of coffee, almost running into Tommy) Oh-ho, whoa!  Sorry, Tommy.  I almost spilled this hot coffee on you.<br>
<br>
<b>Tommy:</b>  Yeah, but you didn’t.<br>
<br>
<b>Ross:</b>  No, but it’s-it’s-it’s hot!<br>
<br>
(We see Tommy go into Joey and Chandler’s apartment)<br>
<br>
<b>Rachel:</b>  Ross, would you just stop it!  It’s getting really old.<br>
<br>
<b>Ross:</b>  I can’t believe no one believes me!<br>
<br>
<b>Phoebe:</b>  I do, I believe you.<br>
<br>
<b>Ross:</b>  You do Pheebs?<br>
<br>
<b>Phoebe:</b>  Yeah.  But I also believed her (points to the phone) when she said I was next.<br>
<br>
[cut to Chandler and Joey’s apartment, Tommy is using the phone]<br>
<br>
<b>Tommy:</b>  (noticing the chick) Ooh, hey!  Hey, there little fella. (picks up the chick) Mr. Fuzzy-Man, how are you doing? (starts to pet him) Aww. (The chick poops on his hand.) Eww!  Oh!  Eww!  Gross!  Idiot!! Stupid little, fuzzy, yellow creature!!  Oh look at me, I’m so cute, I’m a little chick who’s disgusting!  God, you’re so stupid, how are you not yet extinct!! (the duck wattles behind him and quacks) (to the duck) Quack-quack, quack-quack!!  What are you quacking about?!  Dumb Donald Doo-Doo!! <br>
<br>
(We see the gang staring at him through the doorways.)<br>
<br>
<b>Chandler:</b>  Step away from the duck.<br>
<br>
<b>Tommy:</b>  Ooh, sorry little Mr. Chic-A-Dee, sorry you went doody in my hand! (starts to walk out and stops) (to Rachel) Well, I guess we’re not going out anymore.  Whaa!!!<br>
<br>
(He leaves the gang in stunned silence.)<br>
<br>
[Scene:  Backstage at Joey’s play, Joey is changing for the next scene as Kate arrives, carrying her bags.]<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b>  Joey!<br>
<br>
<b>Joey:</b>  Hey!<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b>  I’m soo glad I caught you, I couldn’t find you before.<br>
<br>
<b>Joey:</b>  Wh-wh-what’s going on?  Wh-what’s this about L.A.?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b>  They still want me for <i>General Hospital</i>.<br>
<br>
<b>Joey:</b>  But, but wh-what about us?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b>  Last night was wonderful.  But I-I can’t stay here just for you.<br>
<br>
<b>Joey:</b>  Well, so, stay for the museums! <br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b>  I’m sorry.<br>
<br>
<b>Stage Manager:</b>  Joey, onstage!<br>
<br>
<b>Joey:</b>  Well can you at least stay to the end of the play?  I mean, I’ll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.<br>
<br>
<b>Lauren:</b>  (yelling from onstage) Where are you Vic?<br>
<br>
<b>Kate:</b>  Flight’s in an hour.  I-I gotta go.<br>
<br>
<b>Lauren:</b>  Vic!  Vic!  <b>Vic</b>!!!  <br>
<br>
<b>Joey:</b>  (to Lauren) In a minute!!<br>
<br>
[cut to the end of the play]<br>
<br>
<b>Lauren:</b>  So this is it?  Victor?<br>
<br>
<b>Joey:</b>  Yeah, I guess it is.  (sees Kate is watching, he turns Lauren so that he can talk directly to Kate, but still look like he is talking to Lauren) Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick ‘cause this is killing me.  One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you.  But, you’ve got things you have to do now, and so do I.  And so?I’m gonna get on this spaceship, (smoke starts pouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, with flashing, coloured lights on the side of it) and I’m gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels.  But when I return, 200 years from now, you’ll be long gone.  But I won’t have aged at all. (gets on the ladder) So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I’m gonna want to meet her. <br>
<br>
(The ladder retracts, taking Joey up into the spaceship for his voyage to Blargon 7, and Kate waves good bye.)<br>
<br>
<b>Lauren:</b>  So long, Vic! (waving good bye as the ladder retracts)<br>

<br>
<b>Phoebe:</b>  No, no, no, oh no-no-no, it’s has to be 800. (picks up the instruction manual to check the phone number) ‘Cause all those big companies have 800 numbers, every one.  (Finds the number) Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one.<br>
