      <P>Teleplay: Sherry Bilsing - Graham &amp; Ellen Plummer<BR>Story: Brian 
      Buckner &amp; Sebastian Jones<BR>Directed by: Gary

      <H3>Scene: Central Perk - Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Ross and Rachel are 
      sitting on the sofas. Joey enters</H3>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Ok.</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> Alright!</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> But ehm...what is it not?</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> <I>(abashed)</I> A place to entertain my lady friends.</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> And what else is it not?</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> <I>(even more abashed)</I> A place to eat spaghetti.</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Very good! <I>(Gives him the keys)</I> What do you need 
      it for anyway?</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and 
      they don't sell tickets here in New York, so...</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut?</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> <I>(hesitates for a moment)</I>Yeah Connecticut...Not West 
      Virginia.</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy some 
      tickets myself! </P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> Uh!</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 
      300 million dollars.</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 
      million? No thank you!</P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> Hey will you get me tickets too?</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all pitch 
      in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split 
      it!</P>
      <P><B>Everyone almost simultaneously except Ross:</B> yeah thats a great 
      idea!</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> No thanks!</P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> You don't wanna win the lottery?</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> <I>(in a mocking voice)</I>Uh...sure I do, and I also 
      wanna be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia 
      Earhart.</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Still on Amelia Earhart?</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> The woman just vanished!</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? 
      I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 
      times.</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get 
      struck by lightning 7 times.</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> I like those odds!</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going to spend 
      250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki.</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> <I>(looking around at the others)</I>I'll ask. <I>(To 
      Ross)</I> Boohaki?</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're 
      trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, 
      goshdarnit and brotherpucker.</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> How do you know she's gonna start talking?</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she 
      understands what I'm saying.</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Kinda like Joey.</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> <I>(who wasn't paying attention)</I>What's that now?</P>
      <P class=center><B>Opening credits</B></P>
      <H3>Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica, Chandler, Rachel and 
      Joey are in the kitchen</H3>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You 
      know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Pie eating contest?</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I 
      could win something? </P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> <I>(smiling)</I>That was a good day!</P>
      <P><I>(Suddenly Ross comes running into the apartment)</I></P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> <I>(yelling to Monica)</I>They're towing your car, they're 
      towing your car!!</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> I'm parked in a garage on Morton! </P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> <I>(panting)</I>They're towing <SPAN 
      style="FONT-STYLE: italic">a</SPAN> car. And I am seeing...spots.</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> <I>(sounding panicky)</I>Oh my god Ross! You don't have 
      Emma! And Rachel you don't have Emma! <I>(Starts yelling)</I> Where's 
      Emma? Who has Emma!?</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You 
      were there!</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> <I>(not yelling anymore)</I>I was?</P>
      <P><B>Racel:</B> Yes and you talked to her...</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> I did?</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> She dropped off a casserole?</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> Oh yeah! The casserole lady.</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> <I>(to Ross)</I>So, did you come by to watch us win the 
      big bucks?</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all 
      go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top 
      of it!</P>
      <P><I>(phone starts ringing and Chandler comes running out of the 
      bathroom)</I></P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> <I>(hysterical)</I>Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, 
      I'll get it, I'll get it!! <I>(picks up the phone)</I></P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> <I>(to Monica)</I>Think he washed his hands?</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> <I>(into receiver)</I>Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you 
      know?</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> <I>(to Monica)</I>What's going on?</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an 
      assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only 
      hiring three.</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> Ooh! Tough odds!</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> <I>(mockingly)</I>Yeah if only it were a sure thing like 
      your 24 state lottery!</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> <I>(smiling)</I>Look who's coming around!</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> <I>(still on the phone)</I>Damnit. Alright call me 
      when you know more.</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> <I>(excited)</I>Did you get it?</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> One of the slots got filled.</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> <I>(Still excited)</I>By you!?</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your 
      pants!</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Yeah I know.</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> Well, there's two spots left right?</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wanna get 
      one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care about 
      Charlie.</P>
      <P><I>(Phoebe enters)</I></P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> <I>(excited)</I>Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going to 
      believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna 
      win the lottery tonight!</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra 
      luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> <I>(mockingly)</I>A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give 
      someone else a chance!</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Alright, who wants to do it?</P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. It's 
      really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat the meat 
      doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Ok, hey Rach?</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all 
      over my hands.</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of 
mine.</P>
      <P><I>(Phoebe and Joey both grab one side of the wishbone)</I></P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> I hope I win!</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing 
      for the same thing, right?</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you 
      know...won't come true!</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Right! .. but we "know" what you're wishing for!</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> Can't really say!</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> I understand, but you're wishing for what we think 
      you're wishing for, aren't you?</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> <I>(slightly irritated)</I>I'm not really comfortable with 
      these questions!</P>
      <P><B>Rachel, Chandler and Monica:</B> Please, just do it!</P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> One, two, three!</P>
      <P><I>(they break the wishbone)</I></P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> I won, hey!</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, 
      you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp! 
      <I>(rubs lamp, stops because it's very hot)</I> Ah!! That thing gets 
      hot!!</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you 
      gonna feel if we actually do win?</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> Uh, you're not gonna win.</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but 
      somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel? You 
      know, we're gonna be all like "oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up 
      to the cape" and you're gonna be all like "oh, I can't guys, I'll meet you 
      guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai"</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like 
      that.</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> I can see the headline now: "Lottery winners' friend 
      filled with regret eats own arm".</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> Why would I eat my own arm?</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print 
      whatever we want.</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for 
      you.</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> Why?</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" 
      but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my 
      brother, and I want you to be a part of this.</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just 
      the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! 
      Come here <I>(they kiss and hug)</I></P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> Get a room!</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we 
      win?</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> I don't know, probably just invest it.</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Ooh! Calm down ...</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it? </P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> Oh, I'm sorry, did I say "invest it"? I meant "be cool and 
      piss it all away" <I>(Joey and Chandler pleased)</I></P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the 
      Knicks!</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> I don't really care about the Knicks.</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> <I>(touched)</I> You would do that? I never get 
      picked!</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to 
      go.</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe 
      you're taking this away from me!</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 
      seconds.</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> <I>(to Rachel)</I> Uh, how long until they announce the 
      numbers, Mommy?</P>
      <P><I>(pause)</I></P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> <I>(looks around)</I> I'll take this one too <I>(to 
      Ross)</I> Uh ... Mommy?</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel "Mommy" 
      when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her 
      first word.</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call 
      me "Daddy" too.</P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> Oooh, I like that, "daddy" <I>(in a sexy tone)</I></P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> I ... I was just talking about Rachel.</P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> <I>(still in sexy tone)</I> Oooh, is daddy getting 
      angry? Is daddy gonna spank me?</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> <I>(tries to be sexy too)</I> Well that depends ... have 
      you been a baaad gi .. <I>(stops)</I> no I can't.</P>
      <P><I>(Phone rings, Chandler picks up)</I></P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear? 
      ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with him!! .. 
      Alright, bye. <I>(hangs up)</I></P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, 
right?</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as 
      anybody else of getting that job!</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> He's the boss's son.</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Come on, lottery!! <I>(everybody cheers)</I></P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as 
      quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas 
      how to organize this? <I>(doesn't let them answer)</I> Ok, how about this: 
      we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by 
      whoever finishes their pile first.</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> Ooh, I have another idea!</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> I'm sorry, idea time is over.</P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Yeah.</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> What about the ones you have on the nightstand?</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> There are no tickets on the nightstand!</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.</P>
      <P><I>(Rachel get suspicious)</I></P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the 
nightstand!</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Chandler, sense the tone!!</P>
      <P><I>(Rachel comes out of their bedroom waving tickets)</I></P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!</P>
      <P><I>(everyone's shocked)</I></P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and 
      Chandler.</P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this 
      together!</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> 3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ...</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when 
      did you even get those?</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking 
      off the plastic!</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> <I>(to Ross)</I> I'll show you how.</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your "special" tickets 
      win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your 
      friends?</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna 
      leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I 
      couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was 
      wrong?</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> <I>(to Mon)</I> She's right, you shouldn't have bought 
      tickets just for us ...</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Ahhh! <I>(shocked)</I></P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Let me finish ... <I>(to everyone else)</I> however, 
      it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have 
      principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!! <I>(takes tickets from 
      Rachel)</I></P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> There's the man I married!!</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's the 
      last you're gonna hear from us!</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, 
      and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like 
      you!</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> <I>(surprised)</I> OH! Alright, you know what? That's 
      it! I want my share of the tickets <I>(picks up the bowl)</I>!</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> Yeah, I want my tickets too <I>(takes the bowl from 
      Rachel)</I>! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> Than I want mine, too <I>(takes the bowl from Joey)</I>! 
      And if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.</P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together 
      <I>(takes the bowl from Ross and puts it on the table)</I></P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> No, no! We should divide them up <I>(picks up the 
      bowl)</I> and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This 
      all thing was my idea! <I>(takes the bowl from Monica)</I></P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up! 
      <I>(she tries to snatch the bowl from Joey's hands but she can't, so she 
      pinches his nipple and she manages to take it)</I></P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> <I>(in pain)</I> Oh!</P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> <I>(she takes the bowl from Rachel's hands and she 
      starts running around the room and yelling)</I> OOOOOHHHHH!</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> <I>(trying to stop her)</I> Hey, hey!!</P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> <I>(keeping on running and yelling)</I> OOOOOHHHHH! 
      <I>(she stops)</I> Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to 
      this! <I>(she goes out to the balcony)</I></P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> No, no! <I>(they all go towards the balcony but they get 
      jammed in the window)</I></P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at 
      all! So, say goodbye to your tickets! <I>(She holds out the bowl, and 
      makes as to drop the tickets on the street)</I>.</P>
      <P><B>Everyone:</B> NO!!</P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> Don't come any closer!</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are 
      getting squished...</P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> No, what's more important, your friends or money?</P>
      <P><B>Everyone but Monica:</B> Friends! </P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Money! <I>(they all look at her)</I> Friends...</P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my 
      bra <I>(takes some tickets out of her bra and gives them to 
      Phoebe)</I>...</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> Monica!</P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> Ok, good! <I>(pause)</I> You guys were so scared! There 
      was no way I was gonna dump this...<I>(a pigeon swoops down, scaring 
      Phoebe who drops the bowl on the street)</I> Oh God, no! <I>(pause)</I> I 
      think I broke your bowl.</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> Go, go, go!!</P>
      <H3>Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment.</H3>
      <P><I>(All are returning from the street after picking up dropped lottery 
      tickets)</I></P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> What a beautiful night to be running around the street, 
      looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Phoebe, we lost half of them.</P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic 
      said I was gonna win, remember?</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the 
      scary pigeon...</P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to 
      die. <I>(pause )</I> So, excuse me for being a little skittish.</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> <I>(looking at the answering machine)</I> Hey, there's 
      two messages. These could be from work!</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Oh, play them!</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Ok, here we go! <I>(he pushes the play button)</I></P>
      <P><B>Message:</B> <I>(Phoebe's voice)</I> "Hello. Th-this is the pigeon 
      from the balcony calling to apologise" <I>(they all turns to look at 
      Phoebe)</I> "I sh.. I shouldn't have knocked the tickets out of the pretty 
      lady's hand. It-it was all my fault. Not hers. Bye. Coo."</P>
      <P><I>(they all keep staring at Phoebe)</I></P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.</P>
      <P><B>Second message:</B> "Hey Chandler, it's Charlie"</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> This is..shhh!</P>
      <P><B>Second Message:</B> "Listen, oh... it turns I got the last spot. I'm 
      really sorry man, it was a lot of fun working with you. Give me a call if 
      you want."</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Oh God, I am so sorry honey...</P>
      <P><B>All:</B> Oh, so sorry man! Sorry!</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted 
      Sandra over me at work.</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> No, she was just much better at job than me!</P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> Guys, the drawing is about to start!</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> <I>(To Ross)</I> You know what? We should call my mum's 
      house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> Oh yeah, it's a good idea!</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> <I>(she hugs Chandler)</I> Honey, you've been really 
      strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job.</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it. 
      <I>(pause)</I> But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 
      130 chances to win, right?</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> <I>(she draws out a ticket from a pocket of her 
      pants)</I> 131! <I>(they kiss)</I></P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> <I>(on the phone)</I> Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. 
      And remember, you're daddy's little girl... <I>(covering the phone, to 
      Rachel)</I> Phoebe's totally ruined that for me... <I>(he passes the 
      receiver to Rachel)</I></P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> Hi mum, put her back on!</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> <I>(sitting on the sofa in front of the tv)</I> Rach, come 
      on! They are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself 
      changing.</P>
      <P><B>TV:</B> "Here we are, the official Powerball numbers! We have 
53"</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> I got that!</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> Oh, we have one too!!</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> We are on a roll, people!!</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> <I>(calling Rachel)</I> Come on!!</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> <I>(on the phone)</I> Mum, please!I know you love your 
      new lips, but I can barely understand you! Would you, please, just let me 
      say goodnight to my daughter?</P>
      <P><B>TV:</B> "And number 29! Here we go! The Powerball is 7"</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Check your numbers! Make me rich!</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> <I>(she goes towards the others and she's very 
      excited)</I> Guys, you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying 
      goodnight to Emma and she said her first words!!</P>
      <P><B>All:</B> Wow!</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> And what did she say?</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> She said "gleba"!! <I>(she celebrates)</I></P>
      <P><I>(they just look at her for a moment; then they go back to checking 
      the tickets)</I></P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Make me rich!!</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> <I>(to Ross)</I> Isn't that amazing?</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> Oh yeah, no no no...that's great!</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> Why-why aren't you more excited?</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> Oh, Rach...oh..."gleba" is not a word.</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> Oh, but of course it is!</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> Okay, what does it mean?</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> I don't know all the words.</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first 
      words <I>(goes back to checking the tickets)</I>.</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> Yes you did, gleba is a word!</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> Ok, use it in a sentence.</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> Ok... "Emma just said gleba"!</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> It's not a word!</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up <I>(she 
      goes and picks up the dictionary)</I>.</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you're at it she 
      said another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up: 
      pbbqqt....</P>
      <P><I>(Rachel glares at him)</I></P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> <I>(searching the dictionary)</I> Alright, okay, okay, 
      gleba, gleba... <I>(excited)</I> Gleba! Ha! Here it is: the fleshy, 
      spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi.</P>
      <P><I>(Rachel shows Ross the definition on the dictionary, giving him a 
      smug look; then she squints at the dictionary, as though unsure what to 
      make out of it)</I></P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> She's gonna be a scientist! <I>(kisses Rachel on the head, 
      very moved)</I></P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> <I>(checking the last ticket)</I> Damnit! anybody got 
      anything?</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> No.</P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> I'm still looking through mine...</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Just double checking <I>(does so)</I>...no, no, 
      no...<I>(takes off a shoe and takes a ticket out of it)</I> No!</P>
      <P><I>(phone rings)</I></P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> <I>(answering phone)</I> Hello? Hold on. It's your 
      boss.</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Ah, the "I'm sorry I rejected you" phone call. I'm not 
      used to getting it from guys. <I>(on the phone, getting up from the 
      sofa)</I> Hey, Steve.</P>
      <P><B>Steve:</B> Chandler, hi! I'm sure you've heard we filled the three 
      positions. We just felt that with your maturity and experience, you 
      wouldn't be happy being someone's assistant.</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant! 
      Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm not too 
      mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!</P>
      <P><B>Steve:</B> Chandler, you were the strongest person in the program. 
      We're offering you the position of junior copywriter.</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?</P>
      <P><B>Steve:</B> Yes, that's right. We're excited about the level of 
      sophistication you'll be bringing to the job.</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you 
      tomorrow <I>(hangs up)</I>.</P>
      <P><I>(he idly goes to the sofa, starts browsing a magazine. Everybody 
      stares at him)</I></P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> What? <I>(pause)</I> Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior 
      copywriter.</P>
      <P><B>Everybody:</B> <I>(excited)</I> Oh my God, congratulations!</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> You bet! No TV or anything! <I>(she gets up from the 
      sofa and goes to the kitchen area)</I></P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> <I>(to Chandler)</I> Hey, that is so great about the job. 
      </P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Thanks, man.</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> And I like to think I had a little something to do with 
      it.</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Really? What?</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn't wish we would 
      win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job.</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> <I>(smiling, surprised)</I> Oh yeah? <I>(looks towards 
      the kitchen, worried)</I> Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart 
      right out.</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> Oh yeah.</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> You know what? There is a little part of me that really 
      thought we were gonna win.</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> Me too. So much for my dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme 
      park.</P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> You guys, what was the Powerball number again?</P>
      <P><B>Monica and Ross:</B> Seven.</P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> We won.</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> What?</P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> We won!</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> Let me see!</P>
      <P><I>(they all jump up excitedly and try to see the ticket)</I></P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> Don't tear it.</P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers.</P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number, 
      we've won 3 dollars!</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or 
      go for the big payout.</P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> <I>(still very excited)</I> I don't care, I've never won 
      anything before, I can't believe this!</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?</P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.</P>
      <P><B>Monica:</B> You know what? You can have mine.</P>
      <P><B>Chandler:</B> Me too.</P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> Me too.</P>
      <P><B>Rachel:</B> Me too.</P>
      <P><I>(they all look at Ross)</I></P>
      <P><B>Ross:</B> I guess if everybody else is...</P>
      <P class=center><B>Closing credits</B></P>
      <H3>Scene: Central Perk. They're all sitting there as usual, except Joey. 
      Gunther is serving a nearby table.</H3>
      <P><I>(Joey comes in from the back of the coffee house)</I></P>
      <P><B>Joey:</B> <I>(sitting in a chair)</I> Hey guys, so I just called the 
      Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won.</P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> I beg to differ <I>(shows him her cup of coffee and her 
      plate of cookies)</I>.</P>
      <P><B>Gunther:</B> Maybe nobody won the jackpot, but there was this guy in 
      here earlier, and he found the ticket on the street, right outside, and 
      won $10,000 <I>(goes to the counter)</I>.</P>
      <P><I>(They all glare evilly at Phoebe)</I></P>
      <P><B>Phoebe:</B> <I>(hides her mouth behind the cup and speaks in the 
      "pigeon voice" from before)</I> Coo, again. Don't blame the pretty lady. 
      It was not her fault. It was me, the pigeon, coo! <I>(pause)</I> 
      Seriously, stop staring at her.</P>
      <P><I>(Joey stares around dumbly looking for the "talking pigeon")</I></P>
