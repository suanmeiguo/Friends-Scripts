Guess what...</p><p><b>Joey: </b> Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?! </p><p><b>Monica: </b><i>(shocked)</i> Really? <i>(She looks around, suddenly embarrassed)</i> Let's get past the moment. </p><p><b>Phoebe: </b> What's your news? </p><p><b>Chandler: </b> Thank you. I got a job in advertising. <i>(Everybody cheers)</i></p><p><b>Monica: </b><i>(hugging Chandler)</i> Oh, honey, that's incredible! </p><p><b>Phoebe: </b><i>(inquisitive)</i> Gosh, what's the pay like? <i>(Everybody stares at her indignantly)</i> Oh, come on people...<i>(defending)</i> come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most! <i>(She looks at Joey)</i> Hey Joey! <i>(Joey winks at her)</i></p><p><b>Chandler: </b> Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship. </p><p><b>Joey: </b> Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'. </p><p><b>Chandler: </b> Right. So, it'll be the same except...less sex with you. <i>(Joey nods)</i></p><p><b>Ross: </b> So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there? </p><p><b>Chandler: </b> Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like. </p><p><b>Phoebe: </b><i>(enthusiastic)</i> That's great. </p><p><b>Chandler: </b> Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating </p><p><i>(At the same time, Gunther puts down a cup of coffee in front of Chandler)</i></p><p><b>Chandler: </b><i>(grinning awkwardly)</i> Humiliating and noble! </p><p><i>(Gunther shoots a nasty look at him while leaving)</i></p><p><b>Ross: </b> You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising. </p><p><b>Monica: </b> Ross, you did not come up with &quot;got milk?&quot; </p><p><b>Ross: </b> Yes, I <b>did</b>, I <b>did</b>! <i>(He turns to Joey, disappointed)</i> I should have written it down! <h3>Scene: <br>Monica and Chandler's Aparment, Monica sits at the table </h3></p><p><b>Joey: </b><i>(entering)</i> Hey! </p><p><b>Monica: </b> Hey! </p><p><b>Joey: </b> Where's Chandler?

You got that audition. </p><p><b>Joey: </b> With Lennart Haze? </p><p><b>Rachel: </b> Yes. </p><p><b>Joey: </b> Oh my god, that is great! That is *** for a play on broadway...and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time. </p><p><b>Monica: </b> Is it a good play? </p><p><b>Joey: </b> Well, it must be, because I read and I didn't understand a singe word. </p><p><b>Rachel: </b> Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it...</p><p><b>Joey: </b> Yeah, yeah, and directing. </p><p><b>Monica: </b><i>(sighs)</i> He was so good in that movie of MacBeth. </p><p><b>Rachel: </b><i>(disbelieving)</i> You saw that? </p><p><b>Monica: </b> No, but...I saw the previews. They played it right before Jackass. </p><p><b>Rachel and Joey: </b><i>(pointing at Monica, a look of recognition in their faces)</i> Ah! </p><p><b>Joey: </b> Yeah, he's done some amazing works. </p><p><b>Rachel: </b> Oh, yeah. Oh, I loved him in those cell phone commercials. </p><p><b>Joey: </b><i>(almost laughing)</i> I know. When the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone. <i>(They all laugh)</i></p><p><b>Monica: </b> Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition! </p><p><b>Joey: </b><i>(sitting down)</i> Don't make me more nervous than I already am! <h3>Scene: <br>Chandler's new workplace, his fellow interns are already seated around a table </h3></p><p><b>Chandler: </b><i>(entering)</i> Good morning, everybody. </p><p><b>Intern: </b> Can I get you a cup of coffee, Sir? </p><p><b>Chandler: </b> Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys...except for the tie, the briefcase...and the fact that I can rent a car. </p><p><b>Intern: </b> Seriously, you're an intern? </p><p><b>Chandler: </b> Yeah, well, I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom. </p><p><b>Intern: </b><i>(shaking his head disbelievingly)</i> Dude! </p><p><b>Chandler: </b> Right. Look, I know I'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like I'm Bob Hope <i>(he sits down)</i></p><p><i>(Everybody gives him an inquiring look)</i></p><p><b>Chandler: </b> The comedian? USO?! </p><p><b>Intern: </b><i>(correcting him)</i> Uhm, it's USA, sir. </p><p><i>(Chandler desperately covers his head in his hands)</i><h3>Scene: <br>Audition room, Joey is lead into the room by a receptionist in a fancy dress </h3></p><p><b>Receptionist: </b> This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze. </p><p><i>(Lennart Haze turns around in his chair to face Joey)</i></p><p><b>Joey: </b> It is so amazing to meet you. <i>(They are shaking hands)</i> I'm such a big fan of your work. </p><p><b>Lennart: </b> Well, I've...I've been blessed with a...a lot of great roles. </p><p><b>Joey: </b> Tell me about it! &quot;Unlimited nights and weekends!&quot; </p><p><b>Lennart: </b> You making fun of me? Because I am not a sell-out. <i>(He stands up and walks menacingly towards Joey)</i> I didn't do that for the money, I believe in those phones. I almost lost a cousin because of bad wireless service. </p><p><b>Joey: </b> No, I-I-I wasn't making fun of you, honestly, I-I think you were great in those commercials. </p><p><b>Lennart: </b> Really? </p><p><b>Joey: </b> Yeah. </p><p><b>Lennart: </b> Well, I do bring a certain credibility to the role. </p><p><b>Joey: </b><i>(regaining confidence)</i> Are you kiddin'? When they shoot you out of that cannon...</p><p><b>Lennart: </b> Peeeeeooooooooch <i>(He mimes flying out of the cannon)</i> &quot;Hang up that phone!&quot; One take! </p><p><b>Joey: </b> Wow! </p><p><b>Lennart: </b> So, shall we read? </p><p><b>Joey: </b> Oh, yeah, sure. </p><p><b>Lennart: </b> Top of act two. This is my entrance. You got it? </p><p><i>(Joey nods whereupon Lennart acts as if he is entering a room)</i></p><p><b>Lennart: </b> &quot;What the hell are you still doing here&quot;? </p><p><i>(Joey stares at him, fascinated by his performance)</i></p><p><b>Joey: </b> Err, &quot;I think you know&quot;. </p><p><b>Lennart: </b> &quot;Bastard&quot;! </p><p><b>Joey: </b> &quot;I am what you made me. You know what? I could go right now.&quot; </p><p><b>Lennart: </b> &quot;Go, go!&quot; </p><p><b>Joey: </b> &quot;I can't. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can't.&quot; </p><p><b>Lennart: </b> I'm sorry, sorry. You're not supposed to say &quot;long pause&quot; </p><p><b>Joey: </b><i>(understandingly)</i> Oh, oh, I thought that was your character's name, you know, I thought you were like an Indian or something, you know with a...<i>(He mimes wearing a feather on his head)</i></p><p><b>Lennart: </b> No. Thank you so much for coming in. We appreciate it, thank you. </p><p><b>Joey: </b> Ah, y-y-you're sure you don't want me to do it again? I could do it with an accent, you know, Southern <i>(He speaks in what he believes is a Southern accent)</i> &quot;I could go right now, maaan!&quot; </p><p><b>Lennart: </b><i>(stunned, muttering)</i> My god in heaven. </p><p><i>(The producers stand up)</i></p><p><b>Producer #1: </b> Joey, hang on for a second. Lennart, can we talk to you for a moment? </p><p><i>(They stand aside, talking)</i></p><p><b>Lennart: </b> You, you gotta be kidding. See, h-he, he can't act. <i>(Joey hears that and his disappointment is reflected in his facial expression)</i>. </p><p><i>(Producer #1 whispers something)</i></p><p><b>Lennart: </b> Hey! I-I-I don't care if he's hot, you know. If you want to sleep with him, do it on your own time. <i>(Joey smiles smugly at this)</i> This is a play. No, listen: if you insist on this, I will call my agent so fast on a cell phone that has a connection that is so clear he's gonna think I'm next door. </p><p><i>(Joey approaches them)</i></p><p><b>Joey: </b><i>(interrupting their conversation)</i> Ah, hi, ah. Thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what I did wrong, I'd just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you. And, and also: <i>(to Producer #1)</i> 'How you doing?' <i>(to Lennart again)</i> You should, please, just gimme another chance. I really wanna get better, please. </p><p><b>Lennart: </b> Well, if you wanna come back at the end of the day today, here are my notes. Ready? </p><p><b>Joey: </b> Yeah. </p><p><b>Lennart: </b> Uhm, you're in your head. You-you're thinking way too much. </p><p><b>Joey: </b> I really doubt that. </p><p><b>Lennart: </b><i>(explaining to Joey, who nods fervently.) </i> No, no, no. It's that you're not connected with anything in your body. There's no urgency. The scene is a struggle, uhm, it's a race. Also, what you did was horizontal. Don't be afraid to explore the vertical. And don't learn the words. Let the words learn you. </p><p><i>(Joey ponders on this for a while)</i></p><p><b>Joey: </b> (suggesting.) Couldn't I just sleep with the producer? <h3>Scene: <br>Backstreet, Ross and Phoebe walking </h3></p><p><b>Phoebe: </b> Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight? </p><p><b>Ross: </b> Oh, I can't. I've got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know we've been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about her. </p><p><b>Phoebe: </b> Oh, I hear divorce bells. </p><p><i>(A mugger, his face hidden by a cap, approaches them from behind)</i></p><p><b>Mugger: </b> Alright. Just give me your wallets and there won't be a problem. </p><p><b>Ross: </b><i>(taken aback)</i> What? </p><p><b>Mugger: </b> I have a gun <i>(It looks like he has a gun under his coat)</i></p><p><b>Ross: </b> O-ok. Just relax, Phoene, just stay calm. <i>(He searches his coat and freaks out)</i>. Oh my god, I can't find my wallet. </p><p><i>(He finally finds the wallet and hands it to the mugger)</i></p><p><b>Mugger: </b> Alright, lady, now give me your purse!<b><br></b><br><b>Phoebe: </b> No. </p><p><b>Ross: </b><i>(still in a high-pitched voice)</i> What do you mean &quot;no&quot;? I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay. </p><p><i>(A sign of recognition runs across Phoebe's face)</i></p><p><b>Phoebe: </b> Lowell, is that you? </p><p><b>Lowell: </b> Phoebe? <i>(He lifts his cap)</i> Oh my god! </p><p><b>Phoebe: </b><i>(simultaneously)</i> Oh my god! </p><p><i>(They hug and scream)</i></p><p><b>Phoebe: </b><i>(excited)</i> I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell, Ross. </p><p><b>Lowell: </b> Ross, nice to meet you. <i>(He stretches his hand out to him)</i></p><p><b>Ross: </b> Yeah, a real pleasure. </p><p><b>Phoebe: </b> Ah, it's been so long, so long. <i>(They hug again)</i> I can't believe you're still doing this! </p><p><b>Lowell: </b> Oh, I know, but I quit smoking! </p><p><b>Phoebe: </b> Good for you! </p><p><b>Lowell: </b> So you look like you're doing really well! I guess you're mugging days are behind you? </p><p><b>Phoebe: </b> Uh-huh.<i>(she nods)</i></p><p><b>Ross: </b><i>(shocked)</i> Oh my god. Phoebe, you used to mug people? </p><p><b>Phoebe: </b> Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up...<h3>Scene: <br>Monica and Chandler's Apartment, Monica sits on the couch as Joey enters </h3></p><p><b>Monica: </b> Hey, how did the audition go? </p><p><b>Joey: </b> Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me. <i>(He sits down)</i></p><p><b>Monica: </b> What happened? </p><p><b>Joey: </b> Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less. </p><p><b>Monica: </b> So far so good! <i>(Joey nods)</i></p><p><b>Chandler: </b><i>(entering, carrying a large box)</i> Honey, I'm old! </p><p><b>Monica: </b><i>(standing up, walking towards him)</i> What's wrong? </p><p><b>Chandler: </b> I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them. </p><p><b>Monica: </b> So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience. </p><p><b>Chandler: </b> Yes, but I don't think life experience with these. <i>(He opens the box and takes an inline skate-like sneaker out)</i></p><p><b>Joey: </b> Wooooooooow <i>(He takes the sneaker)</i> It's like they're on fire!</p><p><b>Monica: </b> What are they? <i>(They sit down again.)</i></p><p><b>Chandler: </b> They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these. </p><p><b>Joey: </b><i>(determined)</i> I'll give you $500 for them! </p><p><b>Chandler: </b> What am I supposed to do with these? </p><p><b>Monica: </b> Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time. </p><p><b>Chandler: </b> Well, first of all, they're not called &quot;sneakers&quot; anymore. Apparently, they're called &quot;kicks&quot; or &quot;skids&quot; and I think I heard somebody say &quot;slorps&quot;. <i>(He takes a sneaker)</i> And here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! <i>(to Monica)</i> Would you help me try to sell these? </p><p><b>Monica: </b> Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers? </p><p><b>Chandler: </b> No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for. </p><p><b>Joey: </b> Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords? <h3>Scene: <br>Central Perk, Monica sits on the couch as Phoebe and Ross enter </h3></p><p><b>All: </b> Hey, hey! </p><p><b>Ross: </b> Hey, you'll never guess what just happened...Phoebe and I got mugged! </p><p><b>Monica: </b> You okay?! </p><p><b>Ross: </b><i>(sitting down)</i> Yeah, because Phoebe knew the mugger! </p><p><b>Monica: </b><i>(bewildered)</i> How do you know a mugger? </p><p><b>Phoebe: </b> I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us. </p><p><b>Ross: </b> You wanna know how she knew him? <i>(He points at Phoebe)</i> Because Phoebe used to mug people. </p><p><b>Monica: </b><i>(shocked)</i> Seriously? </p><p><b>Phoebe: </b> Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know...sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I...</p><p><b>Monica: </b><i>(disapproving)</i> Phoebe, that is awful! </p><p><b>Phoebe: </b> Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony...I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer...</p><p><b>Monica: </b> You're mother killed herself! </p><p><b>Phoebe: </b> She was a drug dealer! </p><p><b>Ross: </b> Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because <i>(menacingly)</i> I was about to do some serious damage! </p><p><b>Phoebe: </b><i>(laughing)</i> Okay...</p><p><b>Monica: </b> Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross. </p><p><b>Phoebe: </b> Why? </p><p><b>Monica: </b> Well, Ross was mugged as a kid. </p><p><b>Phoebe: </b><i>(worried)</i> You were? </p><p><b>Ross: </b> Yeah, it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marc's Comics...you know, I-I-I was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble Spiderman got into that week- </p><p><b>Monica: </b><i>(coughing)</i> Wonderwoman! </p><p><b>Ross: </b> Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone...<i>(He looks at Monica)</i> ...when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says: &quot;Gimme your money, punk!&quot; </p><p><b>Phoebe: </b><i>(shocked)</i> Oh my god...</p><p><b>Ross: </b> I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book: &quot;Science Boy&quot; </p><p><b>Monica: </b> Oh yeah! What was his superpower again? </p><p><b>Ross: </b> A superhuman thirst for knowledge. </p><p><b>Monica: </b> That's it. </p><p><b>Ross: </b> Well, I-I better get to class <i>(He stands up)</i> Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe? </p><p><b>Phoebe: </b> No...actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street...that's where Stabby Joe works. </p><p><i>(Ross leaves Central Perk.)</i></p><p><b>Phoebe: </b> Okay, I think we have a problem here. </p><p><b>Monica: </b> What? </p><p><b>Phoebe: </b> Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics. </p><p><b>Monica: </b> Yeah? </p><p><b>Phoebe: </b> Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat. </p><p><b>Monica: </b> So? </p><p><b>Phoebe: </b> Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said- </p><p><b>Phoebe  and Monica: </b> &quot;Geology rocks!&quot; </p><p><b>Monica: </b> Oh my god! </p><p><b>Phoebe: </b> I know...I mugged Ross! <h3>Scene: <br>Audition room, the producers and Lennart are waiting for Joey </h3></p><p><b>Receptionist: </b> You're late! </p><p><b>Joey: </b><i>(entering)</i> I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom? </p><p><b>Receptionist: </b> No, Lennart doesn't wait! </p><p><b>Joey: </b> But I'm bursting with u-hu! </p><p><b>Lennart: </b><i>(spotting Joey)</i> Joey! Here we go. Let's go very quickly! </p><p><b>Joey: </b> Actually, I really need...</p><p><b>Lennart: </b><i>(interrupting)</i> We must go now, quickly, please. </p><p><b>Joey: </b> Yes...ahahaaa <i>(He seems to be in pain)</i></p><p><b>Lennart: </b> Ready? &quot;What the hell are you still doing here?&quot; </p><p><b>Joey: </b><i>(walking on the spot)</i> &quot;I think you know!&quot; </p><p><b>Lennart: </b> &quot;Oh, you sick bastard!&quot; </p><p><b>Joey: </b> &quot;I am what you made me! You know what?&quot; </p><p><b>Lennart: </b> &quot;What?&quot; </p><p><b>Joey: </b> &quot;I could go right now.&quot; </p><p><b>Lennart: </b> &quot;Then go, go!&quot; </p><p><b>Joey: </b><i>(urgent)</i> &quot;I, oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!&quot; </p><p><b>Lennart: </b> Cut! That was good. <i>(He turns to the producers)</i> That was very good. You did everything I asked for. </p><p><b>Joey: </b><i>(disbelieving)</i> I did? </p><p><b>Lennart: </b> Yes. Plus...what you've got that...I don't know what you've got going...this squirmy quality that you bring into the character that I couldn't've even imagined. Wow, hey, here's what we gonna do: come back tomorrow for the final callbacks with the ***, do all of this what you've got going now, but &#150; you know what? &#150; more, more. Can you do that? </p><p><b>Joey: </b> Sure, yeah.
