I feel like we're all growing up. Person named Wiener, God that kills me. (Laughs)</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Look at you all grown up.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Actually, you know what? I am.

And looks aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you set me up with someone, and we double date!</p><p><b>Joey:</b> I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Done.

What was his name?</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a good idea. In fact, I think he's dead.</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well.</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot.</p><p><b>Ross:</b> You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like! (Walks back into his room.)</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> (Grabs the phone and stars dialing) (On phone) (In a high pitch voice) Wiener, Wiener (In a low pitch voice) Wiener, Wiener!!!</p><p><b>Ross:</b> (Comes back into the living room) Rachel!!!</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Great!

(Looks through his address book) There's no guy in there! </p><p></p><h3>SCENE: Chandler and Monica's apartment</h3><p></p><p><b>Rachel:</b> It's impossible to find a good doctor.

I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> He saw a therapist?</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out.</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Why? What was it?</p><p><b>Monica:</b> That I was going to eat him.</p><p></p><h3>SCENE: Central Perk</h3><p></p><p>(Joey walks in and looks around. He's trying to find a Mike for Phoebe)</p><p><b>Joey:</b> MIKE!!!</p><p><b>Mike:</b> Yeah? </p><p><b>Joey:</b> (Checks him out) Okay! (Walks over to his table and sits down with him)</p><p></p><h3>SCENE: Restaurant</h3><p></p><p><b>Mike:</b> I gotta tell you, I can't believe I'm doing this with you. Although I did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so I guess I should be open and taking some risks.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay? All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.</p><p><b>Mike:</b> I am Mike.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Atta boy!</p><p>(Phoebe and Mary Ellen enter.)</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, look...</p><p><b>Everyone:</b> (Ad-lib hellos)</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do you and Joey know each other anyway?</p><p><b>Mike:</b> How do I and Joey know each other? Wow, if I had a nickel for every time somebody has asked me that.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> (Laughs) From school.</p><p><b>Mike:</b> Yeah, we met in college. (Off Joey's look) I mean, high school.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up to these days?</p><p><b>Mike:</b> Well, I'm a lawyer.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Mike, 'attorney at law'!</p><p><b>Mike:</b> Actually, I just gave up my practice.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.</p><p><b>Mike:</b> I always wanted to play piano professionally, and I figured if I don't do this now, I never will.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law thing, so...</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike.</p><p><b>Mary Ellen:</b> I thought you thought he was still a lawyer.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.</p><p></p><h3>SCENE: Chandler and Monica's apartment</h3><p></p><p>(Monica Enters. Chandler is in the kitchen with his laptop)</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p><p><b>Monica:</b> What are you doing?</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> That's so sweet. Find anything?</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Slim Pickings.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Nothing, huh?</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite. </p><p><b>Monica:</b> 'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> 'So Cheesy' also has an opening.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> (On phone) Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo 'I'll take it!'</p><p></p><h3>SCENE: Pediatrician's office</h3><p></p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment for Emma.</p><p><b>Receptionist:</b> Dr. Gettleman is finishing up with a patient, he should be out shortly.</p><p><b>Dr. Gettleman:</b> (To a patient) I think you just have a cold, it's definitely not Strep.</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks doctor.</p><p><b>Dr. Gettleman:</b> Would you like a lollypop?</p><p><b>Ross:</b> You even have to ask?! (He grabs a lollypop out of a jar) (Sees Rachel) (To Rachel) He is alive!</p><p></p><h3>SCENE: Restaurant</h3><p></p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out. Mike hit my mom with a car.</p><p><b>Mike:</b> No, I didn't.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're friends again everything's great!</p><p><b>Mary Ellen</b> Wait, is your mom okay?</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Please, we're trying to have a conversation. (Pushes the wine glass closer to Mary Ellen.)</p><p><b>Mary Ellen:</b> Wow, you're a lot nicer on 'Days of Our Lives'.</p><p><b>Mike:</b> 'Days of Our Lives'! That's why you look so familiar!</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?!</p><p><b>Mike:</b> What?!</p><p><b>Joey:</b> What?!</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Do you not know each other?</p><p><b>Joey:</b> (Laughs) Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other. We played all kinds of games. (To Mike) Hey, remember the one where I punch you in the face for not being cool?!</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters does Joey have?</p><p><b>Mike:</b> (Joey holds up six fingers) Six!</p><p><b>Joey:</b> What are you doing? I said seven! (Holds up six fingers.) (Realizes his mistake) Argh!!!</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.</p><p><b>Mike:</b> I'm sorry too. And just to be clear, I didn't hit his mother with a car.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> (To Joey) You are unbelievable! I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose.</p><p><b>Mary Ellen:</b> Hey!</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Who are you kidding? (To Joey) You just find some guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like this guy I can find you a better one. (Looks around) Mike!! Mike!!</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> I'm out of here (She leaves)</p><p><b>Mike:</b> It was nice meeting you!</p><p><b>Joey:</b> (To Mary Ellen) You're leaving too?</p><p><b>Mary Ellen:</b> I'll stay if you can tell me my name.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Good night! </p><p></p><h3>SCENE: Chandler and Monica's apartment</h3><p></p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> You're right. (Pause) Maybe I shouldn't go.</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p><p><b>Monica:</b> So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo. It's just a little outside of Tulsa.</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> How far outside?</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Manhattan.</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> And you're thinking of taking it? (Pause) So before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now it's old job, (Raises his hand) me, (Raises his hand) new job. </p><p><b>Monica:</b> I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> I think you should take the job.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Really?</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!</p><p>(Ross and Rachel enter with Emma.)</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p><p><b>Monica:</b> How was the pediatrician?</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I really liked him. (Looks at Ross) Yeah, it was really, really, really good.</p><p><b>Ross:</b> You promised you wouldn't say anything.</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> I know. (Pause) Ross still sees his pediatrician!!! (To Ross) I don't care!</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?</p><p><b>Ross:</b> He's a brilliant diagnostician!</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!</p><p><b>Ross:</b> It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!</p><p></p><h3>SCENE: Central Perk</h3><p></p><p><b>Mike:</b> Excuse me, hi. I was hoping I would run into you. Can we talk?</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Sure.</p><p><b>Mike:</b> I'm sorry, really, I'm so embarrassed. Really, I'm a pretty nice guy. Just ask my parole officer...Apparently I'm not a funny guy.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Why did you go along with that?</p><p><b>Mike:</b> Because I was told I'd get a free dinner, which I didn't. And that I'd meet a pretty girl. Which I did.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> That's true. (Pause) Well, is anything you told me about yourself true?</p><p><b>Mike:</b> My name in Mike, and I do play piano.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Prove it.</p><p><b>Mike:</b> There isn't a piano here.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.</p><p><b>Mike:</b> (Plays 'air piano')</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.</p><p><b>Mike:</b> Really?</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uhuh.</p><p><b>Mike:</b> That's great. What kind of music do you play?</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers. </p><p><b>Mike:</b> Do you think that maybe, sometime, I could...</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.</p><p><b>Mike:</b> Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you out?</p><p><b>Joey:</b> (Walks In)</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> (To Mike) Oh, you just caught me off guard! Yeah, that would be nice.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Look at this. My two best friends!</p><p>(Phoebe and Mike look at him, and he goes over to the counter.)</p><p></p><h3>SCENE: Pediatrician's office</h3><p></p><p><b>Ross:</b> Excuse me, I don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby with the rash came in after me.</p><p><b>Receptionist:</b> The doctor will be right with you sir.</p><p><b>Girl:</b> (Reading a book) Mommy, I can't find Waldo.</p><p><b>Ross:</b> With the circus? He's behind the elephant.</p><p><b>Woman:</b> Wow, so your child is a big fan of the Waldo books too?</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way.</p><p><b>Sally:</b> Hi, I'm Sally. So, no ring. Can I assume you are also a single parent?</p><p><b>Ross:</b> I am a single parent.</p><p><b>Sally:</b> It's hard isn't it?
