So what show are you on?</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology.</p><p><i>(Dirk is confused)</i> </p><p><b>Joey:</b> It's a science.</p><p><b>Dirk:</b> Oh! Hey well listen, I play a scientist on &quot;Days&quot;. And my character has just won the Nobel prize.</p><p><i>(Ross looks annoyed hearing that even Dirk's character won a Nobel prize)</i> </p><p><b>Joey:</b> Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.</p><p><b>Dirk:</b> Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.</p><p><b>Ross:</b> I'd lead with that.</p><p><i>(Cut to Monica holding up her shirt, revealing her bra. An actor stands beside her, holding a pen in his hand.)</i> </p><p><b>Monica:</b> That's it, just sign right on the bra <i>(the actor does so)</i>.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Monica!</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!</p><p><i>(Joey, resigned, walks to Rachel's table)</i> </p><p><b>Joey:</b> <i>(To Rachel)</i> What have you got there?</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Ah, let me see! <i>(she hands him a pile of tissues)</i> Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> <i>(drunken voice)</i> I think I am.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> <i>(browsing the tissues)</i> Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug <i>(discards one)</i>. This guy's Canadian <i>(discards another)</i>. And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you $5,000 to get to level three and I don't feel any different.</p><p><i>(Rachel is puzzled)</i> </p><p><b>Joey:</b> <i>(discarding all the remaining tissues one by one)</i> Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> <i>(picking up the tissues)</i> Why, why, what's wrong with<b> these</b> guys?</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey, you're so sweet.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Who <i>(looks around)</i>?</p><p><i>(Joey motions for Rachel to lean in. She does so.)</i> </p><p><b>Joey:</b> Me.</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> <i>(surprised)</i> What? <i>(with a nervous smile)</i> Really?</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it! <i>(they high-five)</i></p><p><b>Joey:</b> Gotcha.</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, Very funny... Joey.</p><p><i>(Joey leaves. Rachel gulps down what's left of her drink and grimaces.)</i> </p><p><i>(Chandler walks in)</i> </p><p><b>Chandler:</b> <i>(to Monica)</i> So, how did<b> you</b> enjoy the play?</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> You really liked it?</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained <i>(bitter woman's tone)</i><b> not to listen</b>! <i>(pause)</i> But after chapter 16: &quot;fat, single and ready to mingle&quot;, I was uplifted.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Oh really!</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!</p><p><b>Monica:</b> No!</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Did somebody sign your bra?</p><p><b>Monica:</b> So I got it when I was 13...</p> <h3>[Scene: At the counter. Ross is sitting there, drinking. Phoebe approaches him.]</h3> <p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?</p><p><b>Ross:</b> It's actually a $1,000,000 prize.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe PhD.</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny...</p><p><b>Ross:</b> And sexy.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Stop going through my stuff <i>(walks away)</i>!</p><p><i>(Rachel approaches Monica)</i> </p><p><b>Rachel:</b> <i>(to Monica)</i> Hey!</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Please, what about you and Chandler?</p><p><b>Monica:</b> That's different! I was drunk and stupid!</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Well hello <i>(points to herself)</i>!</p><p><b>Monica:</b> What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Alright <i>(shrugs)</i>. I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> <i>(pause)</i> I'm gonna do it.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> And I can't stop you.</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> No.</p><p><i>(Rachel goes look for Joey. She sees him and Charlie kissing passionately.)</i> </p><p><b>Ross:</b> <i>(to Rachel)</i> Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?</p><p><i>(Rachel just stands there staring at Joey and Charlie in silence. After a while, Ross turns around and sees them.)</i> </p><p><b>Ross:</b> I'm smarter than<b> him</b>!</p> <h3>Closing credits</h3><h3>[Scene: The theater. Monica, Phoebe and Chandler are sitting in the first line]</h3> <p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, you're so wonderful.</p><p><b>Bitter woman:</b> Why don't you like me!
