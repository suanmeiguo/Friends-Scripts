I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> You do?!</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, you're so sweet. <i>(They hug and kiss.)</i> Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Eh, forget about the future and stuff!

Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.</p><p><b>Monica:</b><i>(laughs)</i> Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Sure you do.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> No, I want everything that you just said.
