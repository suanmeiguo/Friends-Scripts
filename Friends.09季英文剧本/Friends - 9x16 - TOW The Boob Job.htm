Chandler and Monica are looking through some papers.</h3><p><b>Chandler:</b> Did you see our bank statement? Could this be right?</p><p><b>Monica:</b> I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> I'm not sure what they did...but I'm inclined to blame [xxx?].</p><p><b>Monica:</b> I guess with you doing the internship, we're spending more than we're bringing in.</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Oh...But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was...y'know...finding gold.</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month. And maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refridgerator for a change. You're a chef...what can you make out of baking soda and beer?</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> No! We're not borrowing money.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Why not?</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was...well to always knock before going into the poolhouse...But the other thing was...never borrow money.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Wow! I had no idea you had this much pride.</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And i'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.</p><h3>Opening Credits</h3><h3>Scene: <br>Phoebe's apartment. Mike and Phoebe seem to have finished watching a movie on television.</h3><p><b>Mike:</b> I'm gonna go. <i>(He kisses Phoebe on the cheek.) </i></p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Why?</p><p><b>Mike:</b> I haven't been home in a couple of days and I need to get somemore clothes.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh...you don't have to go...I have something that will fit you.</p><p><b>Mike:</b> I put that tube top on as a joke.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> I want you to stay.</p><p><b>Mike:</b> I want to stay too but I've got about as much out of these boxers as I can.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Why don't you turn them inside out?</p><p><b>Mike:</b> Done it. <i>(Phoebe becomes a little more subdued.) </i> I'll be back in a couple of hours.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> I'll miss you.</p><p><b>Mike:</b> Me too. <i>(He leaves. A few moments later, he enters again.) </i></p><p><b>Mike:</b> You know what? I just realized something. I don't wanna go home.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top.</p><p><b>Mike:</b> No, no! What I mean is...I hate going back to my apartment now...And partly because I live above a known crack den but...mostly because when I'm there...It's just...i really miss you. So...Do you want to move in together?</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow...Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say &quot;Hell yeah!&quot;.</p><p><b>Mike:</b> So we're doing it?</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together! <i>(They embrace and Mike kisses Phoebe.) </i></p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh god...We're really going to move in together!</p><p><b>Mike:</b> Yeah!</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> I've always wanted to live with a guy...&quot;Pick up your socks!&quot; &quot;Put down the toilet seat!&quot; &quot;No!

Good.<i>(He winks.) </i>...But wrong.</p><p><b>Monica: :</b><i>(Looks exasperated.) </i> Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Awww...I don't know Monica...You know...erm...lending friends money is always a mistake.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> But Chandler lent you money!</p><p><b>Joey:</b> And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Come on...I just need it for some rent and...and some other bills.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Oh...how much?</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Two thousand dollars?</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Two thousand dollars!?

I realized that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Oh...baby-proofing...Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know...when I was a kid it was like... &quot;Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!&quot; or er... &quot;Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!&quot; Huh!</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Anyway erm...Are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> No. I was just going to do this myself. <i>(Joey makes a sarcastic laugh.) </i></p><p><b>Joey:</b> You're gonna do it?</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah...Why? You don't think a woman can do this?</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Oh...Women can. You...can't.</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?</p><p><b>Monica:</b> You're a pig. And you can't do this.</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Wha!? What!? Come on!

Phoebe and Mike are packing stuff.</h3><p><b>Mike:</b> Well hey...I wanna ask you about Monica's little &quot;groomy&quot; joke.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomie.</p><p><b>Mike:</b> I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was. Now the thing I wanna say is...Maybe we should have talked about this before. Us living together. You're not expecting a proposal...right?</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where it goes.</p><p><b>Mike:</b> Yeah well...that's the thing. For me it's...as far as it can ever go.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> What do you mean?</p><p><b>Mike:</b> Look. Phoebe...I...I love you. Very much. But I never want to get married again.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh. Wow.</p><p><b>Mike:</b> It's just my first marriage was...you know... such a disaster. I kind of lost faith in the whole idea.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Was it really that bad?</p><p><b>Mike:</b> At one point near the end she deliberately defecated.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok...well that's bad...But don't you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in the ocean.</p><p><b>Mike:</b> Look it's not about who I would marry. And I was certain the first time I got married it would last forever. And I was totally wrong!</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> But it's just.</p><p><b>Mike:</b> Look Phoebe...It's not about you. I just never wanna get married again.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh!</p><p><b>Mike:</b> I'm sorry. Are you ok with that? Cause if not...maybe us moving in together isn't the best idea.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in...and you start changing your mind...there's gonna be hell to pay mister!</p><p><b>Mike:</b> Trust me...I will never.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah I get that.</p><h3>Scene: <br>Joey's apartment.

Monica enters.</h3><p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p><p><b>Monica:</b> So you gave in and decided to call someone?</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah...I don't know who I was kidding.

You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not...TWO...single things.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Ok...you're being weird. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> No no! I just love the way you look... I am warm...for your form.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Ok...You know the old classics, you know, &quot;You look nice&quot;? They're still ok.</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Well yes yes...You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your BODY. I mean...I wouldn't change it...At all. And more specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> o...k.</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> I mean...You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.</p><p><i>(He leaves.) </i></p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any weirder.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> I know, why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> I don't know! I mean...what brought that on?</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> No...you really think that's what it is?</p><p><b>Monica:</b> You heard him! &quot;No bigger!&quot; &quot;You're perfect!&quot; &quot;Just don't get any bigger!&quot; Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah! If you don't I will! Of course your body's gonna change. Your breasts are gonna get bigger...Your ass is gonna get bigger...You're gonna lose bladder control. <i>(she starts sobbing.) </i> God! It's just such a magical time!</p><h3>Scene: <br>Ross's apartment.

You know...that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks!</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah...marriage...stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> That's not how you really feel is it?</p><p><b>Ross:</b> No, I'm sorry. LOok I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but I can't help it. I love marriage.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Seriously? You divorce-o?</p><p><b>Ross:</b> If you have to call me name, I prefer Ross the Divorcer. It's just cooler. Look...I know my marriages haven't exactly worked out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Caroline and I had some good times before she became a lesbian! And once afterward. I'm sorry.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> It's ok that's how you feel.</p><p><b>Ross:</b> But come on! I mean living together will be great!

I mean can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> They are awfully boxy.</p><p><b>Ross:</b> I don't know...you'd be so bored with marriage.
