I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But<b> SURPRISE</b>!</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> I missed most of the party <i>(pause)</i> Charlie's a girl, right?</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did<b> not</b> kiss.</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls at the party, GOD!</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Why do you care so much?</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Yes Rachel, why<b> do</b> you care so much?</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> <i>(worried)</i> Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... and I... want him to hook up with lots of women! <i>(pause)</i> I just... All I'm saying is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils...</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh, those nerds will get<b> laaaaaid</b>!</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean...</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with it...</p><p><i>(Joey and Charlie enter. Ross looks at her)</i></p><p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, God. I forgot how<b> hot</b> she was!</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p><p><b>All:</b> Hi!</p><p><b>Ross:</b> I'm gonna get some more coffee.</p><p><b>Charlie:</b> Oh, you know what? I'll come with you!</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Ok. <i>(they both go)</i></p><p><b>Chandler:</b> <i>(to Joey)</i> So, a professor, uh?</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious <i>(which, being Joey, he mispronounces &quot;amonious&quot;)</i>. <i>(pause)</i> That's not how she used it...?</p><p><b>Charlie:</b> <i>(talking to Ross)</i> I feel like I owe you an explanation. I don't ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. I'm... well, I'm kind of embarrassed. I really hope you don't think less of me.</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.</p><p><b>Charlie:</b> You know, actually I'm a little surprised to myself. I mean, Joey is so different from the guys I usually date. I mean, they're all professors, and intellectuals, and<b> paleontologists</b> mostly, you know, very cerebral...</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, I know the type.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. No? Am I getting close?</p> <p class="center"><b>Opening credits</b></p> <h3>[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment]</h3> <p><b>Phoebe:</b> <i>(entering)</i> Hey!</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey you guys! Look what I just got. <i>(she shows them a pair of slippers)</i></p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> <i>(after a pause)</i> Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh... then I overpaid. <i>(she goes to the bathroom)</i></p><p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, what's this?</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage chains.</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting...</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Do you wanna go hunting?</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I would like to have the option!!</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> <i>(coming back from the bathroom)</i> What's up? <i>(she sees the gift certificate in Rachel's hands)</i> Hey, Rachel!!</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh!</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these &quot;big massage places&quot;! They're putting people like me out of business!</p><p><b>Monica:</b> And she wants to go hunting, too!!</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok, this is not about the<b> MONEY</b>, ok? It's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> I don't care about any of that!!</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, do you care about friendship?</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh!</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Promise?</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> I promise.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thank you. <i>(she tears up the gift certificate)</i></p><p><b>Rachel:</b> But I am going hunting!!</p> <h3>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment]</h3> <p><b>Monica:</b> <i>(entering)</i> Hey honey! I missed you today!</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, yeah?</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah. <i>(they kiss)</i> What d'you wanna do tonight?</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, well... Maybe we could... <i>(he sweeps the stuff off the table and wordlessly invites Monica to have sex on it)</i></p><p><b>Monica:</b> Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> We really need to take those tests?</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> But I don't wanna do it in a cup!</p><p><b>Monica:</b> What is the big deal?</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> It's weird! In a doctor's office?</p><p><b>Monica:</b> It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> <i>(embarrassed)</i> I cannot believe Ross told you that! <i>(pause)</i></p> And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think it's a good idea!</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!</p><p><b>Monica:</b> <i>(really embarrassed)</i> OH!</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!</p> <h3>[Scene: Joey's apartment]</h3> <p><b>Joey:</b> <i>(sipping red wine from a glass)</i> Who says that wine has to cost more than milk!</p><p><i>(somebody knocks the door, Joey opens and it's Charlie)</i></p><p><b>Joey:</b> Heeey!</p><p><b>Charlie:</b> Hi!</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Come on in, how are ya?</p><p><b>Charlie:</b> I'm good!</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Can I offer you a drink?</p><p><b>Charlie:</b> <b>Please</b>, I've been crazed all day! I had a meeting with the Dean, and my syllabus for summer school is due and I'm writing the Foreword for a friend's book...</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to open a door and go <i>(looking scared)</i> ohhhh!</p><p><b>Charlie:</b> So I am just so excited to be here. And I can't wait to start exploring the city!</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, if you need a tour guide... <i>(point to himself)</i></p><p><b>Charlie:</b> Oh, you mean it? That would be so<b> fun</b>!</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?</p><p><b>Charlie:</b> Oh, well, we can go see the Chronos Quartet at the Avery Fisher Hall.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> <i>(looking puzzled and nodding)</i> Ok!</p><p><b>Charlie:</b> And there is a collection of Walt Whitman letters on display at the public library.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> I know, yeah!</p><p><b>Charlie:</b> And first, I have to see the MET!</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna see the Yankees.</p><p><b>Charlie:</b> No, no, no, not the Mets, the MET, singular!</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Which one, they all suck!</p><p><b>Charlie:</b> The museum!</p><p><b>Joey:</b> <i>(looking puzzled)</i> I don't think so.</p> <h3>[Scene: SPA massage center, Rachel enters]</h3> <p><b>Rachel:</b> <i>(to the receptionist)</i> Hi there!</p><p><b>Receptionist:</b> <i>(in an affected tone)</i> Hello, welcome to Lavender Day Spa SPA. How may I help you?</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and here is my gift certificate.</p><p><b>Receptionist:</b> This has been torn up.</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> And... taped back together.</p><p><b>Receptionist:</b> Ok well, I'll call you as soon as your massage therapist is ready.</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok</p><p><b>Receptionist:</b> Have a seat through the glass doors.</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> <i>(imitating the receptionist's tone)</i> through the glass doors.</p><p><b>Receptionist:</b> Through the glass doors.</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Alright-y then.</p><p><i>(Phoebe enters the hall)</i></p><p><b>Receptionist:</b> Phoebe, your next client's in the waiting room.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? <i>(She sees Rachel)</i> Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone who can fill in for me?</p><p><b>Receptionist:</b> Sorry, everyone is booked!</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> But that woman can't know I work here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are.</p><p><b>Receptionist:</b> Then why you work here?</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> 'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!</p><p><b>Receptionist:</b> Well, I think this is a great place to work!</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> <i>(watching around and whispering)</i> Ok, are they listening?</p> <h3>[Scene: Central Perk]</h3> <p><i>(Joey walks in and moves towards Ross, who's sitting of the sofa)</i></p><p><b>Joey:</b> Ross!</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Hi!</p><p><b>Joey:</b> I need to talk to you about Charlie.</p><p><b>Ross:</b> <i>(annoyed)</i> Oh, do you, do you really?</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem.</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Look, if you don't know what the word &quot;acrimonious&quot; means, just don't use it!</p><p><b>Joey:</b> No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her body is soo...</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Get to the problem!</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!</p><p><b>Ross:</b> <i>(looking down)</i> Are you wearing two belts?</p><p><b>Joey:</b> <i>(checking)</i> EH, what do you know!</p><p><b>Ross:</b> You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff.

Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!</p><p><b>Joey:</b> The Metsss!</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> <i>(realizing)</i> Oh, that's what she meant! <i>(pause)</i> You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, most of it it's a place <b> packed</b> with confused angry baseball fans!</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!</p><p><b>Ross:</b> But I'm not! <i>(pause)</i>. You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food...</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go<b> way</b> too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Ok.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> You got to tell me exactly what to do there.</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make the right <i>(and he bends his arm to the left. Ross then bends Joey's arm to the right and Joey nods)</i></p> <h3>[Scene: doctor's waiting room]</h3> <p><b>Chandler:</b> I have a weird feeling about this place. <i>(pause)</i> How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody is gonna wanna watch that.</p><p><i>(a nurse walks in)</i></p><p><b>Nurse:</b> Mr. Bing? <i>(Chandler jumps up)</i> Here you are! You'll go into that room and deposit your specimen into the container.</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk.

I mean,<b> why</b>?<b> why</b> is she here??</p><p><b>Janice:</b> Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz they have to do it in a cup! <i>(laughs)</i> Oh! They gave you the kiddy size <i>(looking at the cup in his hand)</i>.</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> What!?</p><p><i>(Janice does her &quot;Janice Laugh&quot;)</i></p><p><b>Monica:</b> This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to! <i>(leaves)</i></p><p><b>Chandler:</b> I'd love to stay, but I have eh... <i>(points at the cup)</i> got a hot date... <i>(starts to leave)</i></p><p><b>Janice:</b> Please... go! <i>(Then shouts after him)</i> Just let me know if you need a hand!</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> <i>(disgusted)</i> I think it just fell off. <i>(Leaves)</i></p> <h3>[Scene: At the Spa, Phoebe is at the half-opened door]</h3> <p><b>Phoebe:</b> <i>(In a strange heavy accent)</i> Hello &quot;ja&quot;, it's time for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole.</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person. <i>(Puts her head in the hole and Phoebe enters)</i></p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, then I'm Swedish...</p><p><b>Monica:</b> So, what's your name?</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh... what an interesting name.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ja!</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> You know I... <i>(lifts her head and tries to look in Phoebe's direction)</i></p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> <i>(pushes her head back down)</i> Time for your scalp massage!</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> <i>(Sees Phoebe's slippers through the hole)</i> Wow... I really love your... <i>(startled as she realizes those are Phoebe's slippers)</i></p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Is something wrong?</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea... <i>(pause)</i></p> Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> <i>(Thinks for a few moments)</i> Uhm... Stockholm.</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!</p> <h3>[Scene: Joey's apartment, Joey and Ross in the living room, rehearsing what Joey will say to Charlie in the Museum]</h3> <p><b>Joey:</b> <i>(gesturing at an imaginary painting)</i> Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Now, do you have any idea what you just said?</p><p><b>Joey:</b> <i>(shaking his head as if to say: of course not!)</i> No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Phonetically? <i>(Looks confused)</i></p><p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time for this.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Ok.</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on &quot;Days&quot; I had to say &quot;Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy&quot;.</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Wow. What does<b> that</b> mean?</p><p><b>Joey:</b> No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means &quot;you're gonna get eaten by a bear&quot;.</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! <i>(Reaches out to touch the imaginary painting)</i>.</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Nah ah! Nah ah! <i>(stops him form doing so)</i> No no no! No ad-libbing and dude, you can't<b> touch</b> the paintings.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Come on! you... <i>(reaches out to touch the imaginary painting again)</i></p><p><b>Ross:</b> No! <i>(Slaps his hand)</i></p> <h3>[Scene: The Fertility Clinic; Chandler walks out one of the rooms]</h3> <p><b>Chandler:</b> <i>(To the nurse at the nurses' station)</i> My specimen is in the room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. Really helped speed the process along! <i>(walks towards the common area and sees Janice is still there)</i> Janice! You're not... gone?</p><p><b>Janice:</b> Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow porn at home so this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit?</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!</p><p><b>Janice:</b> That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.</p><p><b>Janice:</b> Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> <i>(Slightly panicky)</i> Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?</p><p><b>Janice:</b> Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children. I am sure it's gonna be just fine.</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> <i>(smiling again)</i> oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...</p><p><b>Janice:</b> What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you can't do it at a doctor's office?</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> <i>(stares at her intently, then yells)</i> It was a &quot;Wendy's!! &quot;</p> <h3>[Scene: Phoebe and Rachel at the Spa. Phoebe is still massaging Rachel]</h3> <p><b>Phoebe:</b> <i>(Singing)</i> &quot;Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! &quot; And that is the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking! <i>(looks annoyed)</i></p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have a friend who is a masseuse.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, Ja! Ja!</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though... <i>(Phoebe looks devastated)</i></p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> <i>(now lifts her head)</i> Phoebe!!</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> You know it's me?</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> How can you come here?</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> How could you not tell me you worked here?</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> I don't have to tell you everything!</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Tips not included.</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and<b> Ugh!</b> paying taxes!</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles and I<b> so</b> admire that! I don't have any!</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> You know what? You are right. I<b> am</b> gonna quit. It's time I took my life back!</p><p><b>Rachel:</b> Good for you Pheebs!</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay <i>(walks out and closes the door behind her, looks up and whispers)</i> If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean<b> any</b> of that. I love you.</p> <h3>[Scene: Central Perk. Ross is playing some shoot'em up game on his laptop]</h3> <p><b>Ross:</b> Haha! Got ya! Die, die,<b> die</b>!</p><p><i>(Charlie walks in.)</i></p><p><b>Ross:</b> <i>(recovers his composure and starts typing)</i> Respectfully, professor R. Geller. <i>(hits &lt;return&gt;, closes the laptop and joins Charlie on the sofa)</i> Hey!</p><p><b>Charlie:</b> Hi!</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, how was the Met?</p><p><b>Charlie:</b> The museum was amazing!</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?</p><p><b>Charlie:</b> Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to say, and some of it didn't even make any sense.</p><p><b>Ross:</b> What do you mean?</p><p><b>Charlie:</b> Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around.</p><p><b>Ross:</b> <i>(perplexed for a moment)</i> Wait a minute... when you guys walked into the Met, did you go to the right?</p><p><b>Charlie:</b> No, we went to the left.</p><p><b>Ross:</b> <i>(shaking head)</i> Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.</p><p><b>Charlie:</b> Yeah, it's fun <i>(hesitating)</i>.</p><p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p><p><b>Charlie:</b> Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really know me that well; it would be weird.</p><p><b>Ross:</b> What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.</p><p><b>Charlie:</b> Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common with. You know what I mean?</p><p><b>Ross:</b> <i>(slowly)</i> Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.</p><p><b>Charlie:</b> Yeah, I guess that's true.</p><p><b>Ross:</b> And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.</p><p><b>Charlie:</b> He is very sweet. Plus he's<b> hot</b>!</p><p><b>Ross:</b> That was going to be my next argument.</p><p><i>(Joey walks in)</i></p><p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p><p><b>Charlie:</b> Hey!</p><p><b>Joey:</b> <i>(to Charlie)</i> You're ready?</p><p><b>Charlie:</b> Yeah, let's go. <i>(stands up and kisses Joey)</i> <i>(to Ross)</i> Thanks Ross.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> <i>(aside, to Ross)</i> Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me up.</p><p><b>Ross:</b> Glad I could help man.</p><p><b>Joey:</b> Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but... <i>(confidently)</i> I made it work.</p> <h3>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's. Chandler is sitting on the sofa, reading the newspaper.]</h3> <p><b>Chandler:</b> <i>(picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited his specimen in)</i> It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.</p><p><i>(phone rings)</i></p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. <i>(pause)</i> No, she's not here but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? <i>(his smile fades as he hears the answer)</i> Oh. <i>(pause)</i> Well, so what does that mean? <i>(pause)</i></p> Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks. <i>(hangs up)</i></p><p><i>(Monica walks in)</i></p><p><b>Monica:</b> Hey sweetie.</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Doctor Connelly just called.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> With good news? <i>(very quickly and wringing hands)</i> Of course it is not good news, you just said <i>(deadpan)</i> &quot;Doctor Connelly just called&quot;. If it was good news you would have said <i>(excitedly)</i> &quot;Doctor Connelly just called! &quot; But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem with me or with you?</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Actually it's both of us.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Oh... what does that mean?</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. <i>(pause)</i> It means...</p><p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler?</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> <i>(seriously)</i> It means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> <i>(weeping)</i> Oh my God!</p><p><b>Chandler:</b> I'm sorry.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> I'm sorry too.</p><p><i>(they hug)</i> </p><p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.</p><p><b>Monica:</b> <i>(still weeping)</i> I know.</p> <p class="center"><b>Closing credits</b></p> <h3>[Scene: The Spa Reception. Phoebe walks in]</h3> <p><b>Receptionist:</b> Good morning Phoebe.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> <i>(imitating the receptionist's tone)</i> Good morning receptionist.</p><p><b>Receptionist:</b> Here's your schedule for the day. Your first client is in room No. 1.</p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> Rachel Green? <i>(angrily)</i> Son of a bitch, she came back?</p><p><i>(Phoebe walks to the door and half-opens it)</i> </p><p><b>Phoebe:</b> <i>(through the door, with a Scottish accent)</i> Are you ready for your Scottish massage?
