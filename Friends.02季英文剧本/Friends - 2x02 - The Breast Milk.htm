<p></b>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Carol and Susan are showing off Ben to the gang.]</p>

<p>MONICA: (entering from her bedroom carrying a present) Ok, these were unbelievably
expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't
resist. (There a little pair of Nike shoes.)</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. (Ben starts to cry) Oh my god, oh, ok,
was that too much pressure for him?</p>

<p>SUSAN: Oh, is he hungry already?</p>

<p>CAROL: I guess so. (Carol starts to breast feed Ben.)</p>

<p>CHANDLER: You know, it's... (sees the feeding taking place next to him) something funny
about sneakers. I'll be right back. (Goes into the kitchen)</p>

<p>JOEY: (joins him) I gotta get one, too.</p>

<p>ROSS: (following them into the kitchen) What are you guys doing?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?</p>

<p>ROSS: Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the
world.</p>

<p>JOEY: Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.</p>

<p>ROSS: This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get
used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask
questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.</p>

<p>(They go back into the living room)</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Carol, Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about
breast-feeding?</p>

<p>CAROL: Sure.</p>

<p>JOEY: Uh, does it hurt?</p>

<p>CAROL: It did at first, but not anymore.</p>

<p>JOEY: Chandler?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: So, uh, how often can you do it?</p>

<p>CAROL: As much as he needs.</p>

<p>JOEY: Ok, I got one, I got one. If he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?</p>

<p align="center">OPENING TITLES </p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, the gang is all there.]</p>

<p>JULIE: Rachel, do you have any muffins left?</p>

<p>RACHEL: Yeah, I forget which ones.</p>

<p>JULIE: Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one? </p>

<p>ALL: No thanks.</p>

<p>JULIE: Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go. (Ties it back up
for her)</p>

<p>RACHEL: (to Julie) Thank you. (under her breath to Chandler) What a bitch.</p>

<p>JULIE: Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdales who's quitting tomorrow
and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of
it?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.</p>

<p>MONICA: Ok, um, I'll go with you. </p>

<p>JULIE: Great.</p>

<p>ROSS: (enters) Hi, honey.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Hey, sweetums.</p>

<p>ROSS: Hello to the rest.</p>

<p>ALL:&nbsp; Hi!</p>

<p>JOEY: Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?</p>

<p>MONICA: It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Come on, you're going to Bloomingdales with Julie? That's like cheating on
Rachel in her house of worship.</p>

<p>MONICA: But I'm--</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.</p>

<p>ROSS: So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?</p>

<p>MONICA: Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.</p>

<p>ROSS: It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.</p>

<p>MONICA: You're welcome.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Woof, woof. </p>

<p>[Scene: A Department Store, Joey is selling men's cologne.]</p>

<p>JOEY: Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for men? <font size="3">Hey Annabelle.</p>

<p>ANNABELLE: Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?</p>

<p>JOEY: Who?</p>

<p>ANNABELLE: Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man.</p>

<p>JOEY: What's he doin' in my section?</p>

<p>ANNABELLE: I guess he doesn't know.</p>

<p>JOEY: Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?</p>

<p>TODD: Mornin'. </p>

<p>JOEY: Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young
Men's to the escalator is my territory.</p>

<p>TODD: Your territory, huh?</p>

<p>JOEY: Yeah. Bijan for men?</p>

<p>GUY: No thanks.</p>

<p>TODD: Hombre?</p>

<p>GUY: Yeah. All right.</p>

<p>TODD: You were saying?</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is there as Monica enters.]</p>

<p>MONICA: Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: What?</p>

<p>MONICA: We were shopping, and we had lunch.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Oh, all right. What did I have?</p>

<p>MONICA: You had a salad.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.</p>

<p>RACHEL: (entering) Hey, guys, what's up.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.</p>

<p>RACHEL: You went shopping for fur?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some,
(sees Monica pointing at her chest) uh, boobs.</p>

<p>RACHEL: You bought boobs?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: (Monica is yanking on her bra strap) Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras. </p>

<p>[Scene: The Department Store, Joey is trying to sell some cologne.]</p>

<p>JOEY: Bijan for men? Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work
you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>ANNABELLE: Oh, actually I sorta have plans.</p>

<p>TODD: Ready, Annabelle?</p>

<p>ANNABELLE: You bet. Maybe some other time?</p>

<p>JOEY: Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan
for men? </p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Carol is dropping Ben off for Ross to watch.]</p>

<p>CAROL: Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before
his naps or he won't sleep.</p>

<p>ROSS: Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we
play. It's like we're father and son.</p>

<p>SUSAN: Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely
person.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Oh, this is so cute.</p>

<p>SUSAN: Oh, I got that for him.</p>

<p>ROSS: My mommies love me. That's clever.</p>

<p>MONICA: Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju-- Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See
ya then. Bye. </p>

<p>RACHEL: Did you just say Hi, Jew?</p>

<p>MONICA: Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it.
Reaffirms his faith.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Ben, dinner!</p>

<p>ROSS: Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast
milk, and you're not supposed to do that.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: What did you just do?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: I licked my arm, what?</p>

<p>ROSS: It's breast milk.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: So?</p>

<p>RACHEL: Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.</p>

<p>JOEY: What is the big deal?</p>

<p>CHANDLER: What did you just do?</p>

<p>ROSS: Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: You won't even taste it?</p>

<p>ROSS: No!</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?</p>

<p>ROSS: Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.</p>

<p>MONICA: Hey, where is everybody?</p>

<p>RACHEL: They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?</p>

<p>MONICA: Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your
jacket.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon. Mon, if
uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?</p>

<p>MONICA: You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.</p>

<p>RACHEL: And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket</p>

<p>MONICA: That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?</p>

<p>MONICA: Judy.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Who?</p>

<p>MONICA: Julie.</p>

<p>RACHEL: What?</p>

<p>MONICA: Jody.</p>

<p>RACHEL: You were with Julie?</p>

<p>MONICA: Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my
brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we
were...shopping.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Oh. Oh my god. </p>

<p>MONICA: Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>MONICA: Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all
right. I never meant for you to find out.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.</p>

<p>MONICA: That is not true!</p>

<p>RACHEL: Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?</p>

<p>MONICA: Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?</p>

<p>RACHEL: Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to
Bloomingdales? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you
right now.</p>

<p>MONICA: Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a
horrible thing. Joanna, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve
thinks. Hi, Steve.</p>

<p>CAROL: How did we do?</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.</p>

<p>ROSS: I did not freak out. </p>

<p>CAROL: Why'd you freak out?</p>

<p>ROSS: Because it's breast milk. It's gross.</p>

<p>CAROL: My breast milk is gross?</p>

<p>SUSAN: This should be fun.</p>

<p>ROSS: No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just don't think breast milk is
for adults.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.</p>

<p>CAROL: Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.</p>

<p>ROSS: That would be no.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Come on. It doesn't taste bad.</p>

<p>JOEY: Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh--</p>

<p>SUSAN: Cantaloupe juice.</p>

<p>JOEY: Exactly.</p>

<p>ROSS: You've tasted it? You've tasted it.</p>

<p>SUSAN: Uh huh.</p>

<p>ROSS: Oh, you've tasted it.</p>

<p>SUSAN: You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.</p>

<p>ROSS: Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Howdy.</p>

<p>JOEY: Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.</p>

<p>JOEY: Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it.
You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed
to mean anything to you.</p>

<p>JOEY: I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know.
Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come
along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?</p>

<p>JOEY: Yeah I guess you're right.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I
say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the
lingerie.</p>

<p>JOEY: I'm gonna do it.</p>

<p>CHANDLER: All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.</p>

<p>MONICA: I don't know what else to say.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.</p>

<p>MONICA: I feel terrible, I really do.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?</p>

<p>MONICA: Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so
terrible?</p>

<p>RACHEL: Yes.</p>

<p>MONICA: It's that terrible?</p>

<p>RACHEL: Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who
might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually, but
now she's actually stealing you.</p>

<p>MONICA: Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just
because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're
my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.</p>

<p>RACHEL: I love you too.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but
um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.</p>

<p>MONICA: Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate
Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy,
and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would
you just give that a chance, for me?</p>

<p>RACHEL: I'd do anything for you, you know that.</p>

<p>MONICA: I'd do anything for you.</p>

<p>PHOEBE: Wait, wait, wait, wait!</p>

<p>JOEY: Mornin'. I said, mornin'.</p>

<p>TODD: I heard ya.</p>

<p>STORE GUY: All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready?</p>

<p>TODD: Ready.</p>

<p>JOEY: Yeah, I'm ready.</p>

<p>CUSTOMER: You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!</p>

<p>STORE GUY: Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?</p>

<p>TODD: I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.</p>

<p>ANNABELLE: My god, what happened?</p>

<p>JOEY: These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'.
Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?</p>

<p>ANNABELLE: Sure.</p>

<p>JULIE: So.</p>

<p>RACHEL: So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know,
we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though,
right?</p>

<p>JULIE: I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally
intimidated by you.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Really? Me?</p>

<p>JULIE: Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted
you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling
that maybe you don't.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Well, you're not totally paranoid.</p>

<p>JULIE: Oy.</p>

<p>RACHEL: Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was
really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I
just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um,
Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.</p>

<p>JULIE: Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?</p>

<p>RACHEL: Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.</p>

<p>JULIE: I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.</p>

<p>RACHEL: All right, Julie. What a manipulative bitch.<b></p>
